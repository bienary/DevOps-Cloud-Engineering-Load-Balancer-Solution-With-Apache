# Load Balancer solution using Apache

Load balancing is an architectural strategy that distributes incoming application or website traffic across multiple backend servers to ensure high availability, scalability, and fault tolerance ⚙️. Instead of relying on a single server, a load-balanced environment uses a dedicated component—called a load balancer—as the unified entry point for users 🎯.

The load balancer evaluates server health and workload, then routes client requests to the most appropriate server, preventing overload, reducing latency, and improving overall system reliability 🚦. This approach enables organizations to scale vertically by adding more resources to one server, or scale horizontally by adding more servers as demand grows, delivering a more flexible and resilient infrastructure 🏗️.

This guide provides a step-by-step approach to deploying and configuring an Apache Load Balancer to enhance the scalability and reliability of the Tooling Website solution 🚀.
